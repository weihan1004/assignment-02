/**
 * Find the maximum unsigned integer in `infilename`.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * - `infilename`: A string representing the file path to open.
 *     - Note: Since the string will not be changed, we declare it `const`.
 *       Since strings are objects (and therefore larger than fundamental
 *       types), we avoid copying it by passing it by reference.
 *
 * Returns:
 * - The maximum integer, or `-1` on error.
 *     - Note: It would be better style in C++ to throw an exception, but we
 *       haven't learned about those yet.

int find_max(const string& infilename);

/**
 * Mark all prime indices in `primes` as `true` and all others as `false` using
 * the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * - `size`: The size of (the number of elements in) the array.
 * - `primes`: An array of boolean values.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - The number `2` is the smallest prime.
 * - When arrays are passed to functions, they decay into pointers (even though
 *   arrays and pointers are not the same thing).  Thus what this function is
 *   actually receiving is a pointer to the first element of the array `primes`
 *   in `main()` (it doesn't make much difference for how we're using it in
 *   this function, but the distinction is important).  This pointer is passed
 *   by value, but the data inside the array is not passed at all: we access it
 *   through the pointer.
 * - It might be better to return the array from the function rather than pass
 *   the array and modify it, but the syntax is relatively uncommon, and might
 *   be confusing.
